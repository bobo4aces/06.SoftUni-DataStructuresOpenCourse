# Data Structures

The data structure course introduces participants to the most used data structures in programming by setting solid foundations and a lot of practical work. You'll see in depth how lists, queues, stacks, hash tables, trees, columns, and some algorithms such as recursively crawl in depth (DFS) and crawl in width (BFS) work. You will learn to work not only with ready-made program libraries, but also to implement your own structures. You will learn how to evaluate when to use the data structure by analyzing the complexity of the algorithms for each operation.
